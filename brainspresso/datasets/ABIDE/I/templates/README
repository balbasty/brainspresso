# Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE-I)

The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I) represents the first ABIDE
initiative. Started as a grass roots effort, ABIDE I involved 17 international
sites, sharing previously collected resting state functional magnetic resonance
imaging (R-fMRI), anatomical and phenotypic datasets made available for data
sharing with the broader scientific community. This effort yielded 1112 dataset,
including 539 from individuals with ASD and 573 from typical controls (ages 7-64
years, median 14.7 years across groups). This aggregate was released in August 2012.
Its establishment demonstrated the feasibility of aggregating resting state fMRI
and structural MRI data across sites; the rate of these data use and resulting
publications (see Manuscripts) have shown its utility for capturing whole brain
and regional properties of the brain connectome in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
In accordance with HIPAA guidelines and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project / INDI
protocols, all datasets have been anonymized, with no protected health information
included. Below, are the specific types of information included in ABIDE I, the
data usage agreement, sign up and data download links.

## Usage Agreement

Consistent with the policies of the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project,
data usage is unrestricted for non-commercial research purposes. We kindly
request that the specific datasets included in analyses be specified appropriately,
and that their funding sources be acknowledged. As per INDI protocol, we simply
require that users register with the NITRC and 1000 Functional Connectomes
Project to gain access.

## ABIDE I Database Initiative

In addition to distributing ABIDE datasets in .tar and .csv file formats
via NITRC as is customary for the FCP, the INDI team has recruited the
efforts of leading informatics platforms. Now available :

* [COINS](http://coins.trendscenter.org/) (Scott et al., 2011)
* [LORIS](https://abide.loris.ca/) (Das et al., 2012)
* [LONI IDA](http://ida.loni.usc.edu/)
* [NITRC-IR](http://www.nitrc.org/ir)
* [NIDB](http://nitrc.org/projects/nidb) (Book et al., 2013)
* [BIRN HID](http://www.nitrc.org/projects/fbirn/)

Each informatics platform has agreed to simultaneously host the ABIDE datasets
prepared by the INDI team. Such coordination will give users an unprecedented
opportunity to sample emerging technologies and explore the value of these
diverse platforms not only for accessing shared data, but also potentially for
their own internal infrastructure needs.
