# Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II (ABIDE-II)

The establishment of ABIDE I demonstrated the feasibility and utility of
aggregating MRI data across sites. However, the complexity of the connectome,
along with the substantial heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and
initial results from ABIDE I data analyses underscore the need for even larger
and better-characterized samples. Accordingly, with support of an award from
the National Institute of Mental Health (R21MH107045), ABIDE II was established
to further promote discovery science on the brain connectome in ASD. To date,
ABIDE II has aggregated over 1000 additional datasets with greater phenotypic
characterization, particularly in regard to measures of core ASD and associated
symptoms. In addition, two collections include longitudinal samples of data
collected from 38 individuals at two time points (1-4 year interval). To date,
ABIDE II involves 19 sites - ten charter institutions and seven new members -
overall donating 1114 datasets from 521 individuals with ASD and 593 controls
(age range: 5-64 years). These data have been openly released to the scientific
community on June 2016. In accordance with HIPAA guidelines and 1000 Functional
Connectomes Project / INDI protocols, all datasets are anonymous, with no
protected health information included.
