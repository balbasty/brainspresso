This folder contains variants of BIDS-compliant phenotype description
files for the ADRC Uniform Data Set metrics provided by the OASIS-III dataset.

The files provided here contain only fields that are present in the
OASIS-III dataset but not in either the UDS v2 or v3 forms.

In particular, file `UDS_c2_neuropsy` stems from the Knight ADRC form, which
incorporates elements from the UDSv3 c2 form, but also adds other tests
that are not part of UDS. The file provided here only includes non-UDS fields.

The finalised JSON files must be built programaticaly by adding fields
from the UDSv2 or UDSv3 JSON files, as necessary. This is done
programatically when using `bdp oasis3 bidsify --keys pheno`.

Note that the file `UDS_b4_cdr.json` has "generic" fields
"DX{d}" and "DX{d}_CODE". These fields must be replaced by
their enumerated versions "DX1", "DX2", ...,  "DX5".
